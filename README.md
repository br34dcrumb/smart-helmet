# Smart Helmet with ESP32

## Description

This project is a smart helmet that uses an ESP32 microcontroller to detect accidents and send an alert to a predefined phone number. The helmet is equipped with an accelerometer to detect sudden impacts and a GPS module to send the location of the accident.

## Features

- [ ] Accident detection using an accelerometer
- [x] GPS location tracking
- [ ] SMS alert to a predefined phone number
- [x] Low power consumption
- [x] Easy to use and configure

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/br34dcrumb/smart-helmet.git
```
2. Install the required libraries
```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```
3. Install the YOLOv3 files and GPS Library
```bash
curl https://github.com/Velleman/VMA430_GPS_Module/archive/refs/tags/v2.0.0.zip -o gps.zip
